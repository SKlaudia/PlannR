							<h3>Interview</h3>
							<p><font color="black">We began by interviewing a few people for a better understanding of our apps needs.<br><br><u> Interviewee 1 : Level 3 college student studying sciences.</u><br><br>
								1.  Level of education?<br>
							</font>
							Level 3 <br><br>
							<font color="black">
							2.  What methods do you currently use to plan and monitor your work and how easy do you find it to keep on top of educational assignments and deadlines with these methods?<br>
							</font>
							She does them all at college. She manages that by finding a quite place without distractions. This helps her to stay up to date with her assignments <br><br>
							<font color="black">
							3.  Do you feel like you have too much school work, do you feel like you have enough time for yourself?  <br>
							</font>
							Feels like she has too much school work and struggled to have time for herself even before starting part time work. After starting to work outside of college, she struggles even more to find time for herself. <br><br>
							<font color="black">
							4.  Do you feel like you are organised with your school work?  <br>
							</font>
							She does feel organised with her school work as doing it all within the college helps her to complete everything on time <br><br>
							<font color="black">
							5.  What features would you find helpful in a management system aimed at helping a student meet their deadlines and targets?  <br>
							</font>
							List of deadlines, deadline notifications and for each deadline a full description of what work needs to be done.  <br>
							<br><br><br><br>
 

 

 
							<font color="black">
							<u>Interviewee 2 (Ripudaman Singh)</u> <br>
							<br>
							1.  Level of education?  <br>
							</font>
							Currently a Level 5 University student <br><br>
							<font color="black">
							2.  What methods do you currently use to plan and monitor your work and how easy do you find it to keep on top of educational assignments and deadlines with these methods?  <br>
							</font>
							I used calendar app until I was in college but ever since I found about Trello during my study in University, I have been using it to plan and monitor my works and I find it quite manageable as it has all the features of calendar app with more of its own features in it. 
							<br><br>
							<font color="black">
							3.  Do you feel like you have too much school work, do you feel like you have enough time for yourself? 
							</font>
							<br>
							Yes, I do feel like I have too much school work and certainly don’t have enough time to spend for myself due to multiple courseworks on every semester and with lots of self-studies on weekdays including working on Tesco during weekends. 
							<br><br>
							<font color="black">
							4.  Do you feel like you are organised with your school work? 
							<br>
							</font>
							Yes, because I keep track of all my courseworks. 
							<br><br>
							<font color="black">
							5.  What features would you find helpful in a management system aimed at helping a student meet their deadlines and targets?  
							<br>
							</font>
							The one that I am using Trello, helps me manage the tasks that need to be done. As an example I can place the courseworks that need to be done in the To Do bar, the courseworks that are currently being done can be placed in Doing bar and courseworks that are finished are placed in the Finished bar. This is helpful as I can keep track of my courseworks which are not finished yet. It’s a free app with easy organization tools.
